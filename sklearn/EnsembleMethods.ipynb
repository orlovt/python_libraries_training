    "# Ensemble Methods\n",

    "The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two families of ensemble methods are usually distinguished:\n",
    "* In averaging methods, the driving principle is to build several estimators independently and then to average their predictions. On average, the combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced.\n",

    "## Bagging Meta Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "In ensemble algorithms, bagging methods form a class of algorithms which build several instances of a black-box estimator on random subsets of the original training set and then aggregate their individual predictions to form a final prediction. These methods are used as a way to reduce the variance of a base estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it. In many cases, bagging methods constitute a very simple way to improve with respect to a single model, without making it necessary to adapt the underlying base algorithm. As they provide a way to reduce overfitting, bagging methods work best with strong and complex models (e.g., fully developed decision trees), in contrast with boosting methods which usually work best with weak models (e.g., shallow decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging methods come in many flavours but mostly differ from each other by the way they draw random subsets of the training set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the samples, then this algorithm is known as Pasting\n",
    "* When samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as Bagging\n",
    "* When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces\n",
    "* Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the method is known as Random Patches\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, bagging methods are offered as a unified BaggingClassifier meta-estimator (resp. BaggingRegressor), taking as input a user-specified base estimator along with parameters specifying the strategy to draw random subsets. In particular, max_samples and max_features control the size of the subsets (in terms of samples and features), while bootstrap and bootstrap_features control whether samples and features are drawn with or without replacement. When using a subset of the available samples the generalization accuracy can be estimated with the out-of-bag samples by setting oob_score=True. "

    "\n",
    "The module sklearn.ensemble includes the popular boosting algorithm AdaBoost, introduced in 1995 by Freund and Schapire.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying weights w_1, w_2, ..., w_N to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to w_i = 1/N, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence "
